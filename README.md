learning to be a developer

Hello Everyone!

My name is Aaron and until recently I was working for a big corporation doing electrical design work.  I hated it and was so stressed I got really sick.  I am now at home recovering and following my dream to learn as much about computer hardware and software as I can.  I wish everyone well.
